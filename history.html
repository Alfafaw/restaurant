<p>Our recipes originally migrated from china to Orlando and were invented by my grandmother who always liked to cook the food she was raised on. My father was then working in the entertainment industry and felt the need to establish a restaurant which had that unique touch to it. Currently, three generations of my family work in our kitchen and our family recipe allow us to create menus like no other.</p>
