At Masori, we believe not only in the satisfaction of customers but also of our staff since it is the staff who make sure that our customers get the best experience possible. A complimentary drink is a tradition that we have always held on to since the restaurant was established and for us, it is a way of sharing with our customers the unique drinks that are made from a range of natural fruits. Most people have discovered one or two drinks or cocktails from our restaurant that have instantly become their favorite and who know maybe more customer will be lucky to experience the same discovery. We take pride in being part of such great experiences. We have managed to open one other venture that solely focuses on spicy food and spices in general. We take pride and find satisfaction in what we do on a daily basis since it comes from the heart with love.
