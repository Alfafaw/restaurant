<p>Ferraro's culinary career began early on, inspired by his Southern Italian parents and their love and respect for quality and tradition.  After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America at age 20, Ferraro sought opportunities to further develop his own creativity. </p>
<p>Ferraro's culinary repertoire flourished during an internship under Chef Waldy Malouf at Beacon Restaurant, followed by Jean-Georges' Mercer Kitchen as Chef de Partie, where he developed and refined his culinary techniques.  He proceeded to New York City's famed 5-star, 5-diamond Four Seasons Hotel where he served as Chef Tournant. It was there where he extended his skills to all outlets of the hotel, landing him at its fine dining restaurant, Fifty Seven Fifty Seven, pleasing the palettes of the restaurant's most exclusive clientele.</p>
